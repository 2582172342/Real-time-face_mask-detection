# Real-time-face_mask-detection
Real-time face mask detection model

Pre-requisites required:
1. dataset taken from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1XDte2DL2Mf_hw4NsmGst7QtYoU7sMBVG
2. Tensorflow version>=2.2
3. Keras version>=2.4
4. OpenCV

CNN model is created and trained on the dataset diving 96.7% accuracy. This model and their weights is then saved in the system and further used in detect.py for real time detection
